# Story 02

As A Developer I want my system to be able to create accounts for new users, and register them in our application.
I also want to build an auth guard which protects my routes so that users who are not logged in can't access them.
And to insure logged out users can't access protected routes I want to use a session management tool for my backend

## Acceptance Criteria

1. creating a Users collection using MongoDB
2. Build a Register Route
3. Build a Login / Logout Route
4. Build an Auth Guard
5. Use as a session management tool
